# WISDM Dataset

The dataset can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/507/wisdm+smartphone+and+smartwatch+activity+and+biometrics+dataset).

After you download the dataset, make sure you place it inside this folder and extract the folder. The form of the data is not 
convenient, so we have to preprocess them.

To do that, run the file **preprocess_dataset.py** file found in this folder. The data are now stored in the **data.csv** 
file and are ready to be used in the project.

The other files contain the implemented models, each file processing a different type of data, so make sure you run the
desired one.
